# Data Activity 10 / Unit 12

## Task

1. A fair die with faces numbered from 1 to 6 is rolled. Calculate the probability that the die lands with an even number uppermost?

2. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is currently the most common cause of death in the UK. In 2002, of 288 332 male deaths, 64 473 were from CHD, and of 318 463 female deaths, 53 003 were from CHD.

Estimate the following probabilities.
The probability that a randomly chosen UK man who dies in a future year will die of CHD.
The probability that a randomly chosen UK woman who dies in a future year will die of CHD.
How accurate are your estimates likely to be?

## Process 

1.  3/6 faces are even (2, 4 and 6) theregore probability is 3/6 = 1/2
  
2a.  Probability that a random chosen UK man who dies will die from CHD;

64 473 / 288 322 = 0.22, therefore probability is 0.22

2b  Probability that a random chosen UK woman who dies will die from CHD;

53
