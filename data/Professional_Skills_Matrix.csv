Professional;Literacy, Communication, Language Skills;Express information effectively to technical and non-technical audiences ;Proficient; My professional background in science and continued development within this  course mean that I have consistent experience in presenting ideas, information and facts to specialist as well as lay-person audiences.  Examples include the final presentation for module 2: Numerical Analysis and The Executive summary submitted for module : Deciphering Big Data.  Area for development:   knowledge  regarding technical terms incomputing/data science;;;Aware;General understanding and basic knowledge
;;Create documents to aid your communication (reports, diagrams, legal descriptions, plans, manuals and charts);Trained;Good expience with document production.  Within this and previous module gained additional skills using lucid to develop  ERDs. Generation of charts in R and Python within prvious modules.   Reading through course text book has provided additional practice in graph development in python (core ebook, python for data analysis  chapter 13): Area for development, continue to practice creating charts/diagrams in python ;;;Trained;Able to apply knowledge, able to work independently under certain conditions 
;Commercial Awareness;Keep current with tools of the industry, as well as emerging technology;Trained;My background is not in computer science so many aspects are knew, however through this and previous modules this continues to develop, this module taught focused on different DBMS, developing my knowledge on SQL and no SQL databases, different cloud srvices and architectures, and the data pipeline.  This is evidenced in the database design report/summary submitted.  ;;;Proficient;Broad and in-depth knowledge, able to work independently with very little supervision
;;Seek opportunites to improve and share knowledge of tools and technoology that may improve productivity;Trained;I have pro-actively reached out to colleagues on the course to knowledge share and discuss work, e.g. API security requirements task (unit 11).  I have discussed with work colleagues about how learnings from this course could be applied to meet business need, for example integrating clinical data and formulation of automated queries to improve data quality and better enable integration of data for analysis;;;Expert;Seen as a subject matter expert, able to lead and train others.
;;Participate in scientific and professional organisations;Proficient;Whilst proficient in participant of such commitees through professional experience, where I am a member of scientific societies (e.g. BSTP), within the computing field my participation is more limited as the subject area is new to me.  However I am seeking to develop this and joined INSTATS (https://instats.org/about?view=about)and have attended relevet lectures through this platform to support my learning (e.g. Machine Learning Essentials).  ;;;;
;;Emphasise quality, customer satisfaction and fair application of policies.;Trained;Through the database build task I considered the impact of the database design on the customer, considering business need, key requirements and consideration of what could be primary issues or frustrations for the end user.  ;;;;
;;Demonstrate familiriaty with codes of conduct for the Computing field.;Trained;In my professional life I work with personal data, I am aware and trained in GDPR, GCP and other relevant policies  However, whilst aware of guidelines related to data security in relation to data privacy acts, I have less experience in the practival implication of these from a computing angle.  This has been developed in this module through reading and discussion with the team on how data encryption and audit logs are implemented and managed;;;;
;Subject understanding, research, critical thinking, time management;Critically analyse complex ideas in concepts in the field of Computer Science;Trained;"My critical thinking skills are well developed however being new to the field of comupter science I can have a tendancy to then get 'bogged down' in understanding detail, improvement in this will help time management.  Development area; work on staying focused on topic when completing a task but make notes of subject areas to read on to continue to expand knwledge";;;;
;;Recognise inconsistencies and gaps in information, and search for additional information when neededâ€¦;Proficient;This skill is well developed as part of my profession life withinin clinical research, as a beginner to the field of computer science I am practiced at questioning what I read and idetifying gaps in information and researching solutions, however this can lead to distraction or going 'off topic' to an extent that can lead to time management issues as mentioned above.  this is an area for development. ;;;;
;;Explore complex real-world problems in a Computing context;Trained;As I progress within the course I am identifying potential opportunities to apply learnt knowledge within my business field, for example utilising arcGIS to map disease patterns and identify potential areas for patient recruitment adjustments. ;;;;
Legal and Ethical;Ethical Awareness;Comply with the letter and spirit of applicable laws;Proficient;As described above, I work daily with ethics and data privacy laws.  I have been a lead within my business for working with human samples and data and work within a field where confidentiality is of utmost importance. ;;;;
;;Maintain privacy and confidentiality of company, co-worker and customer information;Expert;;;;;
Social (inc. Teamwork);Cultural Awareness;Act in the best interest of the community at large - Social (Community) Responsibility;Proficient; As part of my professional life , the patients and people we work with are  of utmost importance within projects.  I work to identify areas where systems can be improved to optimise patient experience.;;;;
;Teamwork, Leadership and Resilience, Time Management;Collaborate effectively in diverse teams to achieve team goals;Proficient;This was highlighted in the Development team project report in module 3:Deciphering team data, the team had vaired abckgrounds are worked well together to add experise from our own fields whilst developing personal learning from others experience. ;;;;
;;Meeting team objectives using teamwork skills;Proficient;;;;;
;;Demonstrate skills in leadership and team building;Trained;Organisation of team meetings, ensuring clear minutes are taken and actionas and timelines are clearly communicated so that expetations are understood. ;;;;
;;Give and receive constructive feedback;Trained;see collaborative discussion contributions (eportfolio and learning platform);;;;

;;Scripting Language (Python);Trained;;;;;
;;Statistical Language (R);Trained;Developed in Numerical Analysis module and demonstrated through assessment;;;;
;;Gits - repository development and maintenance;Trained;e-portfolio is developed using GIT.  I have therefore developed general knowledge of working within Github, uploading and maintaining my documents.;;;;
;;Use of conferenceing technologies and Moodle (VLE);Aware;I have not worked with these;;;;

This is by no means a comprehensive list of Professional skills required for your programme.  It is meant to be used as a guide for your SWOT analysis/action plan as part of your Professional Development Plan (PDP).  ;;;;;;;;
As you progress through the course, you will discover other skills you need to develop or currently have. These can be described in further detail in your SWOT analysis/action plan.  ;;;;;;;;
As this is required in various modules, you may end up with different versions of this Matrix.  You can collate them in your Learning Loop as part of your final PDP at the end of your programme.;;;;;;;;
