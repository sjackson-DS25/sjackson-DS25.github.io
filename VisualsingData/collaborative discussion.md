## Report on Ryanair and Easyjet Websites:  Units 2-4

Based on Ryanair and EasyJet websites this discussion involved writing a omparative report in a table format, describing the attributes, data representation (marks and channels), colour schema, limitations and strengths of the sites and summarising with a personal view of the visualisations used.

## Summary of Discussion Post

| **Category** | **Ryanair** | **EasyJet** |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Attributes** | Departure airport<br>Arrival airport / destination<br>Passengers<br>Dates<br>Type of trip<br>Time of travel<br>Trip duration<br>Cost | Country<br>Key cities<br>Key roads<br>Airports |
| **Tasks viewer undertaking** | Searching destinations based on departure airport, available flights, holiday type, dates, or cost<br><br>Comparing costs across destination, time, and dates | Searching destinations based on departure airport<br><br>Searching which airports serve a destination |
| **Marks and Channels** | **Marks**<br>• Points, lines, and text<br><br>**Channels**<br>• Position – indicating geographical location<br>• Shape – indicating departure versus arrival airports | **Marks**<br>• Points, lines, area, text<br><br>**Channels**<br>• Position<br>• Colour<br>• Size (e.g. major/minor roads)<br>• Zoom-dependent detail |
| **Colour Schema** | Blue, white, and black | Orange, blue, white, and black<br>Multicolour with zoom |
| **Limitations** | Can only visualise details of a single route at a time, making comparison difficult<br><br>May not represent all potential destinations from a departure airport, as only routes meeting selected criteria are shown<br><br>No representation indicating how destinations correlate with multiple holiday types<br><br>Cannot identify departure airports for a specified destination | By showing all airports, roads, and cities the visualisation appears cluttered, and details may overlap<br><br>Not customisable<br><br>No additional information beyond available routes<br><br>Pop-up destination information is obscured by map details |
| **Strengths** | Easy visualisation of available destinations<br><br>Highly customisable (dates, passengers, times, holiday type)<br><br>Map and route options are clear and uncluttered | Underlying map detail provides useful contextual information about surrounding areas<br><br>Quick selection of alternative departure airports via simple interaction |

Personal Views
<br><br>
The Ryan Air site has clear visualisation and customisation options that would be considered beneficial for most users when searching for flight options.  The EasyJet approach enables the user to conduct a search based on a region or nearby city, since the zoom feature loads additional map detail, however the EasyJet site appears cluttered with poorly designed pop-ups which appear under the map details and are therefore unreadable.  Destination airports are highlighted by lines rather than simple points, and for busy airport hubs such as BHX (Birmingham) this results in a suboptimal output where details are obscured.
