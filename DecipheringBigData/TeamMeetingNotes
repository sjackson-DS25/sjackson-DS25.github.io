# This page captures the meeting minutes from the team discussions whilst working on the Development Team Project: Project Report


## Comments and Learnings

To ensure good time managment, both myself and my colleague Dean Carey were keen to get the work underway prior to unit 6 as we recognised that especially with team tasks,it is important to account for extra time to enable all team members to have the opportunity to review and comment, and to enable sufficient opportunity to work on ht e draft

We proactively formed a team developed an initial idea for the business area over email and then scheduled a first meeting to brainstorm ideas and assign tasks.  We were careful to document clear actions and timelines (see meeting one notes)
