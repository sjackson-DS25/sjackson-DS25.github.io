## Comments and Learnings

This page captures the meeting minutes from the team discussions whilst working on the Development Team Project: Project Report

To ensure good time managment, both myself and my colleague Dean Carey were proactive in forming a team prior to unit 6.  We recognnised  that, especially with team tasks, it is important to account for extra time to enable all team members to have the opportunity to review, comment and contribute, and to enable sufficient opportunity to work round individual schedules

We brainstormed inital ideas for the client profile and potential solutions via email and  then scheduled a meeting to refine these and assign tasks.  We were careful to document clear actions, expectations and timelines (minutes for team meeting 1)

Having reached out to additional colleagues and forming a larger team, the initial draft was shared and a second meeting set up to answer team members questions, discuss progress and further ideas and realign tasks and deadlines (minutes for meeting team meeting 2}

We met as a team for a third time to resolve any outstanding comments from the reviews and to finalise the document before submission.

Additional learnings from the team task were captured in the reflectiive essay. 

This activity aligns with learning outcomes 1,2 and  4

Minutes for Team Meeting 1.
------
Meeting 19:30 CET 19th August 2025  
Attendees Dean Carey; Sonya Jackson

Attendees ideas and points for discussion were shared prior to the meeting; including plan for potential client profile, key considerations and options/comparisons of potential databases

Data items/entities were discussed  These may include e.g. patient ID, trial site ID, patient records; trial drug ID; lab results; wearables; images; medical event ID (amongst others).  Consider that the report will focus on selected key fields only rather than an exhaustive list. Action Sonya to draft 'logical design' and draw up ERD to illustrate these and relationships/associations.  

Methods of data validations/cleaning  it was agreed that these need to be auditable.  Various data cleaning methods may be utilised including machine learning approaches and query firing, standardisation of data is important. Action; Sonya to draft initial text capturing key points and share with Dean for further development.

Database model design; it was decided that  a relational database management system could suit client needs .  The importance of database security/encryption was discussed, database must be scalable.  Action: Dean to draft outline of potential DBMS and comparison of SQL based options.


Actions all: initial drafts will be shared during unit 4; 
Next meeting (prior to 25th Aug) will be used to build on and refine drafts, and discuss next steps.
