# Development Team Project / Executive Summary


## Comments and Learnings

The Unit 6 development team project provided an opportunity to collaborate within a group to design and build a logical database for a client of our choice.  The team agreed to develop a DBMS for a global clinical trials organisation.   Working collaboratively enhanced development of ideas by bringing together diverse viewpoints, and through active discussions via email and in team meetings (meeting minutes are shown below).

When developing the executive summary in Unit 11, it became clear that that there were several DBMS solutions with varying opportunities, benefits and limitations, however the proposed solution from the project report was carried forward, as it was considered to best address the regulatory, privacy and data accuracy requirements.   

Understanding primary business needs, whilst contributing expert knowledge of forward-thinking solutions is essential.  For example, within clinical research use of AI is growing but current systems are poorly designed to handle this.  Implementation of machine learning and AI within healthcare presents specific challenges, clinical data is often stored in siloed databases, and careful consideration is needed to  avoid potential biases that may disproportionally affect already disadvantaged groups.  (Kelly et al, 2019)

## Minutes for Team Meeting 1.
------
Meeting 19:30 CET 19th August 2025  
Attendees Dean Carey; Sonya Jackson

Attendees ideas and points for discussion were shared prior to the meeting; including plan for potential client profile, key considerations and options/comparisons of potential databases

Data items/entities were discussed  These may include e.g. patient ID, trial site ID, patient records; trial drug ID; lab results; wearables; images; medical event ID (amongst others).  Consider that the report will focus on selected key fields only rather than an exhaustive list. Action Sonya to draft 'logical design' and draw up ERD to illustrate these and relationships/associations.  

Methods of data validations/cleaning  it was agreed that these need to be auditable.  Various data cleaning methods may be utilised including machine learning approaches and query firing, standardisation of data is important. Action; Sonya to draft initial text capturing key points and share with Dean for further development.

Database model design; it was decided that  a relational database management system could suit client needs .  The importance of database security/encryption was discussed, database must be scalable.  Action: Dean to draft outline of potential DBMS and comparison of SQL based options.


Actions all: initial drafts will be shared during unit 4; 
Next meeting (prior to 25th Aug) will be used to build on and refine drafts, and discuss next steps.

## Minutes for Team Meeting 2.
------

Date 23rd August 2025  
Attendees; Sonya Jackson, Dean Carey, Monique Mizzi


The team discussed the current draft in line with the instructions for the task; It was proposed that we can build on the description of entities and database build; Action Sonya review and expand on entities; Dean add further comments/suggestions re data base build

Action: all - review document as a whole adding comments/edit as needed 

Action: Monique and Sonya, review lecturecast in unit 6 to ensure document aligned with expectations.   

As discussed, Monique and I will aim to have a final draft for team review by 1st Sept.

Next steps
Team to meet again w/c 1st September to finalise
