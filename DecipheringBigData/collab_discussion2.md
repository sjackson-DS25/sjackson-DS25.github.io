# Collaborative Discussion 2


## Comparing Compliance Laws (units 8-10)


My initial post discussed the UK GDPR and the role of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) as an independent regulator for compliance. The post focused on requirements for securing of personal data, described the overarching requirement of UK GDPR that “appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security that is appropriate to the risk are implemented” (United Kingdom, 2018, Art. 32 ) and described the specific checklist advice that ICO provides for businesses in order to ensure that the data security requirements are met.


A colleague added the pertinent comment that in addition to the ICO guidelines, ISO/IEC 27001 compliance helps to provide assurance that data security measures are met.  ISO 27001 is an international standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) and provides a framework for organisations to manage and meet data security requirements (ISO, 2022).


Whilst not mandatory, as an international standard, ISO27001 certification provides confidence to clients that organisations have systems in place to manage risks related to data security. ISO 27001 compliments GDPR by detailing best practices to help achieve the operational and technical measures required to meet Article 32 of the GDPR through  risk mitigation, continuous improvement and clear accountability (IT Governance, 2025); Amtivo, 2025)


In summary, adherence to ICO guidelines alongside ISO27001 compliance provides organisations and their clients with assurances that personal data is handled in a secure manner and that GDPR requirements in relation to data security are met.  It should be noted however that whilst these frameworks help simplify the GDPR compliance process, they are not sufficient to ensure that data protection regulations are fully met, specifically in relation to subject consents, retention and international movement  of personal data.
